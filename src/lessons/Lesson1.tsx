          The facilitation approach to teaching at XYZ emphasizes active
          engagement, where instructors guide, support, and interact with
          students through asynchronous discussions, feedback, and resources,
          rather than delivering traditional lectures. This approach fosters a
          collaborative learning environment that encourages student
          independence and critical thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
          This approach also ensures that instructors are not overwhelmed with
          administrative tasks, allowing them to maintain a sustainable and
          effective teaching practice.
