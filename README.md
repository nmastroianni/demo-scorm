# VITE + REACT + SCORM

This project is attempting to allow the creation of SCORM packages that use React. The experience should resemble what one can achieve with third-party platforms.

## WHAT'S MISSING?

In order for this to work, you will need to unzip the Rustici driver into the public directory which is not included in this repository. You must register for a [Scorm Cloud](https://app.cloud.scorm.com/sc/guest/SignInForm) account, agree to their licensing, and then download their driver.
